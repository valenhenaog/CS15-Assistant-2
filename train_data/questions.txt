I took cs11 last semester, and I am not completely sure if I synced entire account's contents or only the cs11 folder.Would it be appropriate to complete the vscode_setup guide anyway?
In the hw1 spec, can i use the std::stringstream to implement to string. The same way that was done in the lab1?
Could you please help me understand how the what() function knows what message to print? In third_attempt_access, we are calling catch() from &e, but it looks like we never created the e object. I read a geeksforgeeks article about exceptions, and they created a special struct for their exception.Â I am guessing that our exception is created when we use throw(), but would appreciate confirmation/disproval.
