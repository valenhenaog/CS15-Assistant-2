# CS15 Assistant Chatbot

## Project Overview

CS15 Assistant Chatbot is designed to serve as a smart, responsive assistant for
CS15 course-related queries and tasks. Our goal was to create a system that
could understand natural language input, quickly retrieve relevant information
using vector embeddings and FAISS indexing, and deliver concise, accurate
responses. Over the weekend, we set up the data pipeline, implemented the core
chatbot functionality, and integrated advanced search capabilities, making solid
progress toward a fully functional assistant.
