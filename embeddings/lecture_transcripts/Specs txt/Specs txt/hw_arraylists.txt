CS 15 ArrayLists Homework




Introduction
In this assignment you will implement a version of the array list data structure discussed in class that
contains characters.
    Recall that an array list is a kind of list: an ordered collection of data values. “Ordered” here does
not mean “sorted,” it just means that, if there are items in the list, there is a distinct first element,
second element, etc. We will use 0-based indexing, i.e., the first element in an array list will be element
0. Note that an array list cannot have “holes”: if you remove the fifth element (element 4) from a
10-element array list, then there are 9 elements left, and their positions are 0 through 8.
    You will write both the public and private sections of the CharArrayList class. The class def-
inition will go in a file named CharArrayList.h; the class implementation will go in a file named
CharArrayList.cpp. You will also write test code in unit_tests.h (described below). Your goal is
to implement a well-tested array list that a client could pick up and use in their own program.
    We will describe the (public) interface first, give some implementation specifics, and finally sub-
mission instructions.




                                                    1
                                                                                                      2


Program Specification
Important Notes

    • The names of your functions/methods as well as the order and types of parameters and return
      types must be exactly as specified. This is important because we will be compiling the class you
      wrote with our own client code!
    • Any exception messages should likewise print exactly as specified and use the given error type.
    • You may not have any other public functions.
    • All data members must be private.
    • You may not use any C++ strings in your CharArrayList implementation except for:

         ◦ In the toString() and toReverseString() functions.
         ◦ When throwing exception messages.

    • You may not use std::vector or any other built-in facility that would render the assignment
      trivial.




Interface
Your class must have the following interface (all the following members are public):
   • Define the following constructors for the CharArrayList class:
        ◦ CharArrayList()
          The default constructor takes no parameters and initializes an empty array list. This array
          list has an initial capacity of 0.
        ◦ CharArrayList(char c)
          The second constructor takes in a single character as a parameter and creates a one element
          array list consisting of that character. This array list should have an initial capacity of 1.
        ◦ CharArrayList(char arr[], int size)
          The third constructor takes an array of characters and the integer length of that array of
          characters as parameters. It will create an array list containing the characters in the array.
          This array list should have an initial capacity equal to the length of the array of characters
          that was passed.
        ◦ CharArrayList(const CharArrayList &other)
          A copy constructor for the class that makes a deep copy of a given instance.
     Recall that all constructors have no return type.
   • ∼CharArrayList()
     Define a destructor that destroys/deletes/recycles all heap-allocated data in the current array
     list. It has no parameters and returns nothing.
   • CharArrayList &operator=(const CharArrayList &other)
     Define an assignment operator for the class that recycles the storage associated with the instance
     on the left of the assignment and makes a deep copy of the instance on the right hand side into
     the instance on the left hand side.
                                                                                                       3


    • bool isEmpty() const
      An isEmpty function that takes no parameters and returns a boolean value that is true if this
      specific instance of the class is empty (has no characters) and false otherwise.

    • void clear()
      A clear function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It makes the instance
      into an empty array list. For example if you call the clear function and then the isEmpty
      function the isEmpty function should return true.

    • int size() const
      A size function that takes no parameters and returns an integer value that is the number of
      characters in the array list. The size of an array list is 0 if and only if it isEmpty.

    • char first() const
      A first function that takes no parameters and returns the first character in the array list. If the
      array list is empty it should throw an std::runtime_error exception with the message “cannot
      get first of empty ArrayList”. Note that this exception message does not end with a newline.

    • char last() const
      A last function that takes no parameters and returns the last element (char) in the array list.
      If the array list is empty it throws a std::runtime_error exception with the message “cannot
      get last of empty ArrayList”. Note that this exception message does not end with a newline.

    • char elementAt(int index) const
      An elementAt function that takes an integer index and returns the element (char) in the array
      list at that index. NOTE: Indices are 0-based. If the index is out of range it should throw a C++
      std::range_error exception with the message “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where IDX
      is the index that was given and SIZE is the size of the array list. For example: “index (6) not in
      range [0..3)” if the function were to be called using the index 6 in a size 3 array list. Note the
      braces and the spacing, and also note that there is no newline!1

    • std::string toString() const
      A toString function that takes no parameters and has a std::string return type. It returns
      a string which contains the characters of the CharArrayList. The string will be formatted like
      this:
                 [CharArrayList of size 5 <<Alice>>]

      where, in this example, 5 is the size of the array list and the elements are the characters
      ‘A’, ‘l’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘e’. The empty array list would be formatted like this:
                 [CharArrayList of size 0 <<>>]

      Note: There is no newline after the last ].
      Caution: The format of strings is essential to get exactly right, because your output will be
      verified automatically. There is no whitespace printed, except the single spaces shown between
      the words inside the square brackets (i.e. “CharArrayList ‘space’ of ‘space’”, etc. ). The
      capitalization must be exactly as shown.

    • std::string toReverseString() const
      A toReverseString function that takes no parameters and has a std::string return type. It
1
    [N1 ..N2 ) is interval notation for a “half open interval”. See Wikidpedia for more.
                                                                                                 4


  returns a string which contains the characters of the CharArrayList in reverse. The string will
  be formatted like this:
           [CharArrayList of size 5 <<ecilA>>]

  where, in this example, 5 is the size of the array list and the elements are the characters
  ‘A’, ‘l’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘e’. The empty array list would be formatted like this:
           [CharArrayList of size 0 <<>>]

  Note: There is no newline after the last ].

• void pushAtBack(char c)
  A pushAtBack function that takes an element (char) and has a void return type. It inserts the
  given new element after the end of the existing elements of the array list.

• void pushAtFront(char c)
  A pushAtFront function that takes an element (char) and has a void return type. It inserts
  the given new element in front of the existing elements of the array list.

• void insertAt(char c, int index)
  An insertAt function that takes an element (char) and an integer index as parameters and
  has a void return type. It inserts the new element at the specified index and shifts the existing
  elements as necessary. The new element is then in the index-th position. If the index is out of
  range it should throw a C++ std::range_error exception with the message “index (IDX) not
  in range [0..SIZE]” where IDX is the index that was given and SIZE is the size of the array list.
  NOTE: It is allowed to insert at the index after the last element. Note that the braces in this
  message are different from those in the elementAt range error.

• void insertInOrder(char c)
  An insertInOrder function that takes an element (char), inserts it into the array list in
  ASCII order, and returns nothing. When this function is called, it may assume the array list is
  correctly sorted in ascending order, and it should insert the element at the first correct index.
  Example: Inserting ‘C’ into “ABDEF” should yield “ABCDEF” You can rely on the built-in
  <, >, <=, >=, and == operators to compare two chars.

• void popFromFront()
  A popFromFront function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It removes the
  first element from the array list. If the list is empty it should throw a C++ std::runtime_error
  exception with the message “cannot pop from empty ArrayList”.

• void popFromBack()
  A popFromBack function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It removes the
  last element from the array list. If the list is empty it should throw a C++ std::runtime_error
  exception initialized with the string “cannot pop from empty ArrayList”.

• void removeAt(int index)
  A removeAt function that takes an integer index and has a void return type. It removes the
  element at the specified index. If the index is out of range it should throw a std::range_error
  exception with the message “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where IDX is the index that
  was given and SIZE is the size of the array list.
                                                                                                       5


   • void replaceAt(char c, int index)
     A replaceAt function that takes an element (char) and an integer index as parameters and has
     a void return type. It replaces the element at the specified index with the new element. If the
     index is out of range it should throw a std::range_error exception with the message “index
     (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where IDX is the index that was given and SIZE is the size of the
     array list.

   • void concatenate(CharArrayList *other)
     A concatenate function that takes a pointer to a second CharArrayList and has a void return
     type. It adds a copy of the array list pointed to by the parameter value to the end of the array
     list the function was called from. For example if we concatenate CharArrayListOne, which con-
     tains “cat” with CharArrayListTwo, which contains “CHESHIRE”, CharArrayListOne should
     contain “catCHESHIRE”. Note: An empty array list concatenated with a second array list is
     the same as copying the second array list. Concatenating an array list with an empty array list
     doesn’t change the array list. Also an array list can be concatenated with itself, e.g concatenating
     CharArrayListTwo with itself, results in CharArrayListTwo containing “CHESHIRECHESHIRE”.

    You may add any private methods and data members. We particularly encourage the use of private
member functions that help you produce a more modular solution.
    Before you start writing any functions please sit down and read this assignment specification. Some
of these functions do similar tasks. Perhaps it would be prudent to organize and plan your solution
using the principles of modularity, e.g., helper functions. This initial planning will be extremely
helpful down the road when it comes to testing and debugging; it also helps the course staff more
easily understand your work (which can only help).
    Also, the order in which we listed the public methods/functions of the CharArrayList class, is not
the easiest order to implement them in. If you plan your functions out and identify the easy ones it
will make your work easier and your final submission better.
    If you are having issues planning out your assignment we encourage you to come in to office hours
as early as possible.


JFFEs (Just For Fun Exercises)
If you complete the above functions, you may add the following functions. There is no extra credit,
but they’re fun and educational.

   • void sort()
     A sort function that takes no input and has a void return type. It sorts the characters in the
     list into alphabetical order.

   • CharArrayList *slice(int left, int right)
     A slice function that takes a left index and a right index and returns a pointer to a new,
     heap-allocated CharArrayList. The new array list contains the characters starting at the left
     index and up to, but not including, the right index. If the first index is equal to or greater than
     the second, it returns a new, empty array list. The left index must be in the range [0..SIZE)
     and the right index must be in the range [0..SIZE] where SIZE is the size of the array list. Since
     the right index is not included in the final slice, requesting a slice where the right index is 1
     index past the last element is still a valid request. If the either index passed is out of range the
     function should throw a std::range_error with an appropriate message.

Implementation Details
Copy the starter files from /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists to get the exception examples and pro-
gram files with header comments:
   • CharArrayList.h
   • CharArrayList.cpp
   • unit_tests.h
   • timer_main.cpp
   • Makefile
   • simple_exception.cpp
    You will be editing the first three files listed—you should not edit timer_main.cpp, Makefile,
and simple_exception.cpp.
Note: The array list files just contain starter header comments; the testing file contains some examples
to help you get started with testing. You will need to program everything else yourself.
    You should fill out the header comments appropriately (with your name, a statement of purpose
in your own words, etc.), and, of course, you will need to put the C++ code in!
    Implement the array list using a dynamically allocated array as discussed in class. You should
utilize a private expand or ensureCapacity function that increases/expands your capacity by a rea-
sonable factor (and by enough to hold the required data!) each time your array list reaches its capacity.
    The file CharArrayList.h will contain your class definition only. Put the implementation in
CharArrayList.cpp. The file unit_tests.h will contain your unit tests. We will assess the work in
all three files.
    We may not cover exceptions in class. Don’t worry! You can look up how to throw exceptions,
which is all that is required for this assignment. Be sure to read simple_exception.cpp, which came
with the starter code. That file has a few examples of how an exception can be thrown and shows how
exceptions impact program execution. You should play around editing the file until you feel comfort-
able with exceptions. For this assignment, your exceptions should include a string with a relevant error
message (which we’ve specified above). You’ll use the std::runtime_error or std::range_error ex-
ception type, depending on the circumstance.
    You will need to write unit tests to test your code. The advice section (below) has more about
what kinds of things to include here; also, see the provided unit_tests.h for some examples.


timer main.cpp
As mentioned above, when you copy the starter files, you will receive a file named timer_main.cpp.
This file has been fully implemented for you. It contains a main() function, and when compiled and
linked to your completed CharArrayList class, an excutable will be created which runs a number of
CharArrayList operations and prints out the times (in nanoseconds) taken to run those operations. All
of these operations are run on a fresh CharArrayList instance containing 1,000,000 random characters.
Take a look over this file—it’s okay if you don’t understand all of it, but you may find it interesting.
    Once you have fully completed your CharArrayList implementation, you can compile this timer
program by running “make timer” in terminal. This will run the compilation rules we have defined
in the Makefile, and create a new executable which you can run using ./timer. Observe the table of
operations and their time measurements that gets printed. Do these times match your expectations?
We will ask more questions about these times below, to be answered in your README.
                                                                                                          7


Implementation Advice
Do NOT implement everything at once!
Do NOT write code immediately!

Before writing code for any function, draw before and after pictures and write, in English, an algorithm
for the function. Only after you’ve tried this on several examples should you think about coding.
    First, just define the class, #include the .h file in your unit_tests.h (we have already done
this for you), write a dummy test (that does nothing), and run the unit_test command from the
command line.
    This will test whether your class definition is syntactically correct.
    Then implement just the default constructor. Add a single variable of type CharArrayList to a
unit test function, and run your tests.
    Then you have some choices. You could add the destructor next, but certainly you should add the
toString function soon.
    You will add one function, then write code in your test file that performs one or more tests for
that function. Write a function, test a function, write a function, test function, .... This is called “unit
testing.” As you write your functions, consider edge cases that are tricky or that your implementation
might have trouble with. You should write specific tests for these cases.
    Testing is an important part of programming. To give you some guidance on how to thoroughly
unit test a function, we have already included some tests for the insertAt function in unit_tests.h.
The contents of these tests are currently commented out—you should uncomment them after you have
implemented insertAt (and the other functions used in those tests).
    In the example tests we have given, you can see that we have considered many different cases that
the insertAt function may be used in: insertion into an empty list, insertion at the front and back of
a 1-element list, inserting a large number of elements, and inserting into the front, middle, and back
of a larger list. We have even written tests that attempt to insert into and out-of-range index, then
check that the correct exception was raised—you can see these for examples of how to test exceptions.
    It is important to consider all cases a function can be used in when writing tests! This can help
you catch bugs that may not be obvious to the human eye. You should use the insertAt tests we
have provided as guidance for testing your other array list functions—we expect you to be similarly
thorough. If you need help, the TAs will ask about your testing plan and ask to see what tests you
have written.
    We will evaluate your testing strategy and code for breadth (did you test all the functions?) and
depth (did you identify all the normal and edge cases and test for error conditions?). Don’t write a
test for a function and then delete it!
    In addition to testing, be sure your files have header comments, and that those header comments
include your name, the assignment, the date, and the file’s purpose. See our style guide for more
information about commenting your code.
    Finally, you should review the grading process outlined on the course administration webpage.
This includes useful information like how to view your autograder score, the maximum number of
times you can submit, and how many late tokens you can use.


README
With your code files you will also submit a README file, which you will create yourself. The file is
named README. There is no .text or any other suffix. The contents is in plain text, lines less than 80
columns wide. Format your README however you like, but it should be well-organized and readable.
Include the following sections:
                                                                                                         8


 (A) The title of the homework and the author’s name (you)

 (B) The purpose of the program

 (C) Acknowledgements for any help you received

 (D) The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is and its purpose

 (E) How to compile and run your program

 (F) An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used. Given that this is a data
     structures class, you need to always discuss the ADT that you used and the data structure
     that you used to implement it and justify why you used it. Specifically for this assignment please
     discuss the features of array lists, and major advantages and major disadvantages of utilizing an
     array list as you have in this assignment. The algorithm overview is always relevant. Please
     pick a couple interesting/complex algorithms to discuss in the README

 (G) Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts of assignment and the program
     as a whole. You may reference the testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.

 (H) Please let us know approximately how many hours you spent working on this project. This
     should include both weeks one and two.

  (I) Answer the following questions regarding the time measurements taken for the CharArrayList
      operations (see the section titled timer main.cpp for instructions on taking these measure-
      ments).

        1. There are three categories of operations listed (insertion, removal, and access). Within each
           category, list the times each operation took and rank the operations from fastest to slowest.
        2. Discuss these rankings. Why were certain operations so much faster or slower than others?
           Which operations took approximately the same amount of time? What are the features of
           array lists that caused these disparities or similarities in times?

Each of the sections should be clearly delineated and begin with a section heading describing the
content of the section. It is not sufficient to just write “C” as a section header: write out the section
title to help the reader of your file.


Submitting Your Work
Be sure to read over the style guide before submitting to make sure you comply with all the style
requirements. You will need to submit the following files:
      CharArrayList.h, CharArrayList.cpp
      Makefile
      unit_tests.h
      README
     You must submit them via your browser on Gradescope to the assignment hw_arraylists. Submit
these files directly, do not try to submit them in a folder. Note, you should only be submitting these
files. If you feel that you need multiple classes or structs in your solution, please consolidate them into
CharArrayList.h and CharArrayList.cpp.
     Finally, remember that you only get 5 submissions for this (and most) assignments, so use
your submissions wisely. After submitting, you can wait a few minutes then check Gradescope to view
                                                                                               9
