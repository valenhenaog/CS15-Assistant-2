CS 15 LinkedLists Homework




Introduction
In this assignment you will implement a linked list data structure. The list for this assignment will
be a doubly linked character list. You will have to write both the public and private sections of the
CharLinkedList class. The class definition will go in a file named CharLinkedList.h, and the class
implementation will go in a file named CharLinkedList.cpp. We’ll describe the interface first, then
give some implementation specifics, ask you some questions, and finally give submission instructions.
Don’t forget to answer the questions in your README!


Program Specification
Important Notes

    • The names of your functions/methods as well as the order and types of parameters and return
      types must be exactly as specified. This is important because we will be compiling the class you
      wrote with our own client code!

    • Any exception messages should likewise print exactly as specified and use the given error type.

    • You may not have any other public functions.

    • All data members must be private.

    • You may not use any C++ strings in your CharLinkedList implementation, except for

         ◦ In the toString() and toReverseString() functions.
         ◦ When throwing exception messages.

    • You may not use std::vector, std::list, or any other built-in facility that would render the
      assignment trivial.

    • Some functions are required to be implemented with recursion. For these functions, you are
      welcome to write private helper functions that do the recursion.




Interface
Your class must have the following interface (all the following members are public):

   • Define the following constructors for the CharLinkedList class:

        ◦ CharLinkedList()
          The default constructor takes no parameters and initializes an empty list.
        ◦ CharLinkedList(char c)
          The second constructor takes in a single character as a parameter and creates a one element
          list consisting of that character.
        ◦ CharLinkedList(char arr[], int size)
          The third constructor takes an array of characters and the integer length of that array of
          characters as parameters. It will create a list containing the characters in the array.
        ◦ CharLinkedList(const CharLinkedList &other)
          A copy constructor for the class that makes a deep copy of a given instance.

     Recall that all constructors have no return type.

   • ∼CharLinkedList()
     Define a destructor that destroys/deletes/recycles all heap-allocated data in the current list. It
     has no parameters and returns nothing. This function must use a private recursive helper
     function.
                                                                                                       3


    • CharLinkedList &operator=(const CharLinkedList &other)
      Define an assignment operator for the class that recycles the storage associated with the instance
      on the left of the assignment and makes a deep copy of the instance on the right hand side into
      the instance on the left hand side.

    • bool isEmpty() const
      An isEmpty function that takes no parameters and returns a boolean value that is true if this
      specific instance of the class is empty (has no characters) and false otherwise.

    • void clear()
      A clear function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It makes the instance
      into an empty list. For example if you call the clear function and then the isEmpty function
      the isEmpty function should return true.

    • int size() const
      A size function that takes no parameters and returns an integer value that is the number of
      characters in the list. The size of a list is 0 if and only if it isEmpty.

    • char first() const
      A first function that takes no parameters and returns the first element (char) in the list. If the
      list is empty it should throw a C++ std::runtime_error exception with the message “cannot
      get first of empty LinkedList”. Note that there is no newline at the end of this message.

    • char last() const
      A last function that takes no parameters and returns the last element (char) in the list. If the
      list is empty it throws a
      C++ std::runtime_error exception with the message “cannot get last of empty LinkedList”.

    • char elementAt(int index) const
      An elementAt function that takes an integer index and returns the element (char) in the list
      at that index. NOTE: Indices are 0-based. If the index is out of range it should throw a
      C++ std::range_error exception with the message “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where
      IDX is the index that was given and SIZE is the size of the linked list. For example: “index (6)
      not in range [0..3)” if the function were to be called using the index 6 in a size 3 list. Note the
      braces and the spacing!1 This function must use a private recursive helper function.

    • std::string toString() const
      A toString function that takes no parameters and has a std::string return type. It returns
      a string which contains the characters of the CharLinkedList. The string will be formatted like
      this:
                 [CharLinkedList of size 5 <<Alice>>]

      where, in this example, 5 is the size of the list and the elements are the characters
      ‘A’, ‘l’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘e’. The empty list would print like this:
                 [CharLinkedList of size 0 <<>>]

      Note: There is no new line after the last ].
      Caution! Your output will be verified automatically, so the format of strings is
      essential to get right. There is no whitespace printed, except the single spaces
1
    [N1 ..N2 ) is interval notation for a “half open interval”. See Wikidpedia for more.
                                                                                                   4


  shown between the elements inside the square brackets. (i.e. “CharLinkedList
  ‘space’ of ‘space’”, etc. ). The capitalization must also be exactly as shown.

• std::string toReverseString() const
  A toReverseString function that takes no parameters and has a std::string return type. It
  returns a string which contains the characters of the CharLinkedList in reverse. The string will
  be formatted like this:
          [CharLinkedList of size 5 <<ecilA>>]

  where, in this example, 5 is the size of the list and the elements are the characters
  ‘A’, ‘l’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘e’. The empty list would print like this:
          [CharLinkedList of size 0 <<>>]

  Note: There is no new line after the last ]. For this function, you are not allowed to make a
  copy of the list—the fact that it’s doubly linked should be a great help! Also, if you’re not using
  a tail pointer, consider how a recursive helper function might be useful here (hint: this fn might
  also come in handy elsewhere where recursive helper functions are required!)

• void pushAtBack(char c)
  A pushAtBack function that takes an element (char) and has a void return type. It inserts the
  given new element after the end of the existing elements of the list.

• void pushAtFront(char c)
  A pushAtFront function that takes an element (char) and has a void return type. It inserts
  the given new element in front of the existing elements of the list.

• void insertAt(char c, int index)
  An insertAt function that takes an element (char) and an integer index as parameters and has
  a void return type. It inserts the new element at the specified index. The new element is then
  in the index-th position. If the index is out of range it should throw a C++ std::range_error
  exception with the message “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE]” where IDX is the index that
  was given and SIZE is the size of the list. NOTE: It is allowed to insert at the index after the
  last element. Also, the braces in this message are different from those in the elementAt range
  error.

• void insertInOrder(char c)
  An insertInOrder function that takes an element (char), inserts it into the list in ASCII order,
  and returns nothing. When this function is called, it may assume the list is correctly sorted in
  ascending order, and it should insert the element at the first correct index. Example: Inserting
  ‘C’ into “ABDEF” should yield “ABCDEF” You can rely on the built-in <, >, <=, >=, and
  == operators to compare two chars.

• void popFromFront()
  A popFromFront function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It removes
  the first element from the list. If the list is empty it should throw a C++ std::runtime_error
  exception with the message “cannot pop from empty LinkedList”.

• void popFromBack()
  A popFromBack function that takes no parameters and has a void return type. It removes
  the last element from the list. If the list is empty it should throw a C++ std::runtime_error
  exception initialized with the string “cannot pop from empty LinkedList”.
                                                                                                     5


   • void removeAt(int index)
     A removeAt function that takes an integer index and has a void return type. It removes the ele-
     ment at the specified index. If the index is out of range it should throw a C++ std::range_error
     exception with the message “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where IDX is the index that
     was given and SIZE is the size of the list.

   • void replaceAt(char c, int index)
     A replaceAt function that takes an element (char) and an integer index as parameters and has
     a void return type. It replaces the element at the specified index with the new element. If the
     index is out of range it should throw a C++ std::range_error exception with the message
     “index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)” where IDX is the index that was given and SIZE is the
     size of the list. This function must use a private recursive helper function.

   • void concatenate(CharLinkedList *other)
     A concatenate function that takes a pointer to a second
     CharLinkedList and has a void return type. It adds a copy of the list pointed to by the pa-
     rameter value to the end of the list the function was called from. For example if we concatenate
     CharLinkedListOne, which contains “cat” with CharLinkedListTwo, which contains
     “CHESHIRE”, CharLinkedListOne should contain “catCHESHIRE”. Note: An empty list
     concatenated with a second list is the same as copying the second list. Concatenating a
     list with an empty list doesn’t change the list. Also a list can be concatenated with itself,
     e.g concatenating CharLinkedListTwo with itself, results in CharLinkedListTwo containing
     “CHESHIRECHESHIRE”.

    You may add any private methods and data members. We particularly encourage the use of private
member functions that help you produce a more modular solution.
    Before you start writing any functions please sit down and read this assignment specification. Some
of these functions do similar tasks. Perhaps it would be prudent to organize and plan your solution
using the principles of modularity, e. g., helper functions. This initial planning will be extremely
helpful down the road when it comes to testing and debugging; it also helps the course staff more
easily understand your work (which can only help).
    Also, the order in which we listed the public methods/functions of the CharLinkedList class, is
not necessarily the easiest order to implement them in. If you plan your functions out and identify
the easy ones it will make your work easier and your final submission better.
    If you are having issues planning out your assignment we encourage you to come in to office hours
as early as possible.


JFFEs (Just For Fun Exercises)
If you complete the above functions, you may add the following functions. There is no extra credit,
but they’re fun and educational.

   • void sort()
     A sort function that takes no input and has a void return type. It sorts the characters in the
     list into alphabetical order.

   • CharLinkedList *slice(int left, int right)
     A slice function that takes a left index and a right index and returns a pointer to a new,
     heap-allocated CharLinkedList. The new list contains the characters starting at the left index
     and up to, but not including, the right index. If the first index is equal to or greater than the
                                                                                                         6


      second, it returns a new, empty list. The left index must be in the range [0..SIZE) and the right
      index must be in the range [0..SIZE] where SIZE is the size of the list. Since the right index is
      not included in the final slice, requesting a slice where the right index is 1 index past the last
      element is still a valid request. If the either index passed is out of range the function should
      throw a C++ std::range_error with an appropriate message.


Implementation Details
Copy the starter files from /comp/15/files/hw_linkedlists to get the following files with header
comments:

   • CharLinkedList.h

   • CharLinkedList.cpp

   • unit_tests.h

   • timer_main.cpp

   • Makefile

    Implement the list using a doubly linked list. This means that each node has both a next and
a previous pointer.
    The file CharLinkedList.h will contain your class definition only. The file CharLinkedList.cpp
will contain your implementation. The file
unit_tests.h will contain your unit testing functions. We will assess the work in all three files.
    Once again, we have provided you with a fully implemented timer_main.cpp and Makefile—you
should not edit these. As with HW1, once your have completed your CharLinkedList implemen-
tation, run “make timer” to compile your timer executable program, and run ./timer to execute it
and take time measurements.


Implementation Advice
Do NOT implement everything at once!
Do NOT write code immediately!

Before writing code for any function, draw before and after pictures and write, in English, an algorithm
for the function. Only after you’ve tried this on several examples should you think about coding.
    First, just define the class, #include the .h file in your unit_tests.h (we have already done
this for you), write a dummy test (that does nothing), and run the unit_test command from the
command line.
    This will test whether your class definition is syntactically correct.
    Then implement just the default constructor. Add a single variable of type CharLinkedList to a
unit test, and run your tests.
    Then you have some choices. You could add the destructor next, but certainly you should add the
toString function soon.
    You will add one function, then write code in your test file that performs one or more tests for
that function. Write a function, test a function, write a function, test function, ... This is called “unit
testing.” As you write your functions, consider edge cases that are tricky or that your implementation
might have trouble with. You should write specific tests for these cases.
                                                                                                     7


    If you need help, TAs will ask about your testing plan and ask to see what tests you have written.
They will likely ask you to comment out the most recent (failing) tests and ask you to demonstrate
your previous tests.
    It is important to consider all cases a function can be used in when writing tests! This can help
you catch bugs that may not be obvious to the human eye. If you need help, the TAs will ask about
your testing plan and ask to see what tests you have written. As a hint for writing tests: Notice that
the interface for the CharLinkedList class is the same as the interface for the CharArrayList class
you implemented last assignment.
    We will evaluate your testing strategy and code for breadth (did you test all the functions?) and
depth (did you identify all the normal and edge cases and test for error conditions?). Don’t write a
test a function and then delete it!
    In addition to testing, be sure your files have header comments, and that those header comments
include your name, the assignment, the date, and the file’s purpose. See our style guide for more
information about commenting your code.
    Finally, you should review the grading process outlined on the course administration webpage.
This includes useful information like how to view your autograder score, the maximum number of
times you can submit, and how many late tokens you can use.


README Outline
With your code files you will also submit a README file, which you will create yourself. The file is
named README. There is no .text or any other suffix. The contents is in plain text, lines less than 80
columns wide. Format your README however you like, but it should be well-organized and readable.
Include the following sections:

 (A) The title of the homework and the author’s name (you)

 (B) The purpose of the program

 (C) Acknowledgements for any help you received

 (D) The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is and its purpose

 (E) How to compile and run your program

 (F) An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used. Given that this is a data
     structures class, you need to always discuss the ADT that you used and the data structure
     that you used to implement it and justify why you used it. Specifically for this assignment
     please discuss the features of linked lists, major advantages and major disadvantages of utilizing
     a linked list as you have in this assignment. The algorithm overview is always relevant. Please
     pick a couple interesting/complex algorithms to discuss in the README

 (G) Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts of assignment and the program
     as a whole. You may reference the testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.

 (H) Please let us know approximately how many hours you spent working on this project. This
     should include both weeks one and two.

 (I) Answer the following questions regarding the time measurements taken for the CharLinkedList
     operations (see the explanation of timer main.cpp for instructions on taking these measure-
     ments).
                                                                                                       8


        1. There are three categories of operations listed (insertion, removal, and access). Within each
           category, list the times each operation took and rank the operations from fastest to slowest.
        2. Discuss these rankings. Why were certain operations so much faster or slower than others?
           What are the features of linked lists that cause these disparities?
        3. Now compare these measurements with the measurements you took for HW1. Which op-
           erations are faster when using array lists? Which are faster using linked lists? Why?

Each of the sections should be clearly delineated and begin with a section heading describing the
content of the section. It is not sufficient to just write “C” as a section header: write out the section
title to help the reader of your file.


QUESTIONS
In addition, answer the following questions in your README file:

   • Q1: Which functions in the interface were easier to implement for linked lists compared to array
     lists? Why?

   • Q2: Which functions in the interface were harder to implement for linked lists compared to array
     lists? Why?

   • Q3: If a client had an existing program that uses CharArrayLists, what changes would they have
     to make to their code to switch to CharLinkedLists?


Submitting Your Work
Be sure to read over the style guide before submitting to make sure you comply with all the style
requirements. You will need to submit the following files:
      CharLinkedList.h, CharLinkedList.cpp
      unit_tests.h
      Makefile
      README
    You must submit them using Gradescope to the assignment hw_linkedlists. Submit these files
directly, do not try to submit them in a folder. Note, you should only be submitting these files.
If you feel that you need multiple classes or structs in your solution, please consolidate them into
CharLinkedList.h and CharLinkedList.cpp.

    Before submitting your work, please make sure your code and documentation (including sections
of the README) conform to the course style guide.
