                                  Lab 11: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
                                               COMP 15


1       Introduction
   Today for lab we are going to run Dijkstra’s Algorithm on two different graphs. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
is useful when we want to find the shortest and most cost-effective path between two vertices. Instead of
implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm using C++, today we will use pen and paper (or tablet and stylus) to
report the results of running the algorithm. Please fill out the table provided as shown in lecture, once
you have completed filling out the tables, please submit your work using the usual provide command.
