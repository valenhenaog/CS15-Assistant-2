CS15 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Lab

Introduction
Today for lab we are going to run Dijkstra’s Algorithm on two different
graphs. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is useful when we want to find the shortest
and most cost-effective path between two vertices. Instead of implementing
Dijkstra’s algorithm using C++, today we will use pen and paper (or tablet
and stylus) to report the results of running the algorithm. Please fill out
the table provided as shown in lecture, starting from vertex A. Remember:
initially, the “Known” column should be false for all vertices, and the “Dist”
column should be 0 for the starting vertex, and infinity for all others. Once
you have completed filling out the tables, please submit your work by doing
the following:


   • Copy table.txt into your lab 12 folder by running:
     cp /comp/15/files/lab_dijkstras_algorithm/* .

   • Fill out table.txt and then you will need to submit the following
     files:
                                table.txt

     You must submit them using Gradescope to the assignment lab_dijkstras_algorithm.
     Submit these files directly, do not try to submit them in a folder.
